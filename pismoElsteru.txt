TO-NET Ltd. Novi Sad is a Serbian company that operates in the field of infrastructure information systems
 and remote metering, monitoring and control sistems.
Most of our clients are companies involved in gas, water or heat distribution.

We have developed INIS-SCADA system, the AMI system that incudes:

-	Infrastructure information system

-	Graphical SCADA software for monitoring and controlling distribution process

-	Telemetric/control embedded devices - INIT-50 and INIT-10

We have successfully implemented this system in natural gas distribution sistem, 
where points of interest are metering regulating stations.

We are very interested in cooperation with Elster-Instromet and we would like to become distributors
for Your products and solutions. We are also willing to train two of our engineers for 
Elster-Instromet products.

At this time we are especially interested in following products:

-	Volume correctors EK220/EK230

-	Rotary gas meters RVG Gxxx

-	Solenoid valves for gas (Elster Kromschröder)

We have studied Volume correctors EK220 datasheets and read the line:

"All protocol information is disclosed and is available on request
 for the development of own applications and call-up systems."

Could You please provide us with EK220/EK230 communication protocol information (RS232 or RS485), so we
can establish communication between our Init-50 and volume corrector EK220/EK230.
